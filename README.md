Project Description: AI Legal Advisor for Immigrants

This project involves developing an AI-powered legal advisor designed to assist immigrants with legal information related to immigration law. The application leverages advanced language models from OpenAI and the LangChain framework to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. Users can interact with the AI advisor through both text and voice inputs and receive responses in text and audio formats.

Key Features:

Interactive Chatbot Interface:

Users can ask legal questions by typing or speaking.
The AI provides answers displayed as text and as synthesized speech.
Document Upload Capability:

Users can upload their own legal documents in .txt format.
The AI incorporates these documents into its knowledge base for personalized and accurate responses.
Voice Recognition and Synthesis:

Utilizes OpenAI's Whisper API for transcribing spoken questions.
Employs the gTTS library to convert text answers into speech.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):

Combines information retrieval from documents with language generation.
Ensures answers are accurate and contextually relevant by retrieving pertinent information from the knowledge base.
User-Friendly Interface with Gradio:

Implements a web-based interface using Gradio.
Provides an accessible and intuitive platform for user interaction.
Technical Overview:

Data Processing:

Processes sample legal documents related to immigration law.
Splits documents into manageable chunks using text splitters.
Generates embeddings using OpenAI's embeddings API for semantic search.
Vector Store Creation:

Builds a vector store using FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).
Enables efficient retrieval of relevant document sections based on user queries.
Language Model Integration:

Uses OpenAI's GPT models to generate responses.
Custom prompt templates guide the AI to produce accurate and context-specific answers.
Voice Interaction:

Implements speech-to-text conversion for user questions via microphone input.
Provides audio responses using text-to-speech synthesis.
Use Cases:

Legal Assistance:

Helps immigrants understand visa requirements, asylum applications, naturalization processes, and other legal matters.
Allows users to get information by asking questions in their preferred mode (text or voice).
Document Understanding:

Users can upload legal documents and ask specific questions about them.
The AI provides explanations or clarifications based on the uploaded content.
Ethical Considerations:

Accuracy and Reliability:

Aims to provide accurate information but includes a disclaimer that it is not a substitute for professional legal advice.
Encourages users to consult qualified legal professionals for personalized guidance.
Privacy and Data Security:

Advises users to be cautious when uploading sensitive documents.
Uploaded files are used only during the session and are not stored permanently.
Accessibility:

Incorporates voice interaction to assist users who may prefer speaking over typing.
Strives to make legal information more accessible to non-native English speakers and individuals with disabilities.
